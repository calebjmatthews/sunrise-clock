2018-09-29 Broad steps:
A. Physical Assembly
  1. Research soldering wire onto prototype board
  2. Clip existing test plug from LED strip
  3. Attach ribbon to RP GPIO header
  4. Solder wire from LED strip onto prototype board, per:
    - https://learn.adafruit.com/digital-led-strip/wiring, and
    - https://github.com/longjos/RPi-LPD8806
  5. Test
  Wait, maybe no soldering, breadboard instead!?
